## 🚨 Critical Security Vulnerabilities - RESOLVED

**Date**: June 6, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Risk Level**: HIGH → SECURE  

### Summary of Security Issues Found

1. **🔴 CRITICAL**: Production environment file (`.env.production`) exposed in repository
2. **🔴 CRITICAL**: Log files containing sensitive user data committed to repository
3. **🟡 MEDIUM**: Incomplete .gitignore allowing sensitive file commits

### ✅ Remediation Actions Completed

#### Priority 1 - URGENT (COMPLETED)
- [x] Removed `.env.production` file from repository
- [x] Removed entire `logs/` directory with sensitive data
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive security exclusions
- [x] Committed and pushed security fixes to GitHub
- [x] Verified no actual API keys or secrets remain in codebase

#### Security Fixes Applied
```bash
# Files removed from repository:
- .env.production (contained infrastructure details)
- logs/error.log, logs/exceptions.log, logs/rejections.log, logs/swiftnotes.log

# .gitignore additions:
- .env.production, .env.staging
- *.key, *.pem, *.p12, *.pfx, *.crt, *.cer, *.der
- Additional IDE and OS exclusions
```

### 🔍 Security Verification Results

✅ **No hardcoded API keys found**  
✅ **No actual secrets in codebase**  
✅ **Only example templates remain**  
✅ **Comprehensive .gitignore in place**  

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations for Future Prevention

### Long-term Security Hardening

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Installed in `.githooks/pre-commit`
2. **Environment Management**: Use proper secrets management
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for sensitive file commits
4. **Code Review**: Mandatory security review for all commits
